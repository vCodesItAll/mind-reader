Vanessa language:

need to populate each page with an object index from an array
objects need keys and values
so lets write out the objects with keys and values for each page

p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5

break down pages into 

- array for 
- having buttons (1 rectangular and 1 round)
- an array/grid for symbols/emotes 1-99
- paragraphs
- header

so we will declare those things

recButton is the rectangular button
arrPage is an array that stores each page
arrSym is the array with 0-99 emotes
pageOneHeader is template for header names
pageOnePara is template for paragraph names


let's write sample keys and values for page 1
